# Human vs AI Text Classification

This project explores the problem of distinguishing between texts written by humans and texts generated by artificial intelligence systems.

The goal is not to build a perfect AI detector, but to analyze stylistic and statistical differences between the two types of texts using classical NLP and machine learning methods.

## Project Scope
- Binary text classification (human vs AI)
- Exploratory data analysis and dataset preparation
- Feature extraction from text and writing style
- Training and evaluation of multiple machine learning models
- Error analysis and result interpretation

## Approach
The project follows a modular, pipeline-based architecture that separates:
- data loading and preprocessing,
- feature extraction,
- model training,
- evaluation and visualization.

This design ensures clarity, reproducibility, and easy extensibility.

## Technologies
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- nltk / spaCy
- matplotlib, seaborn

## Notes
This project is intended for educational and research purposes.  
All design decisions and experiments are documented to make the development process transparent.

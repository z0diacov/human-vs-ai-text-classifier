# Project Plan: Human vs AI Text Classification — ENGLISH

This document describes the complete process of building a text classification project, from the initial exploration of the data to the interpretation of the final results. The plan is written in an open and transparent way, so that readers can clearly understand **how the project was developed and why specific decisions were made**.

---

## 1. Problem Definition

- Define the research problem: determining whether a given text was written by a human or generated by an artificial intelligence system.
- Treat the task as a binary text classification problem.
- Clearly state the scope of the project: the goal is to analyze stylistic and statistical differences between texts, not to build a universal or flawless AI detector.

---

## 2. Dataset Exploration

- Review the available dataset and its general characteristics.
- Examine:
  - the structure of the data,
  - available labels,
  - the language of the texts.
- Identify potential limitations of the dataset, such as class imbalance or inconsistencies in text length.

---

## 3. Data Loading and Initial Inspection

- Load the dataset into the analysis environment.
- Inspect the data structure:
  - number of records,
  - column names and data types,
  - missing or corrupted values.
- Ensure the data is suitable for further analysis.

---

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 4.1 Class Distribution
- Analyze how samples are distributed between classes.
- Check for class imbalance.

### 4.2 Text Length Analysis
- Analyze text length:
  - in characters,
  - in words,
  - in sentences.
- Compare length distributions between classes.
- Evaluate whether text length alone could bias the classification.

### 4.3 Lexical Analysis
- Examine word and phrase frequency.
- Compare vocabulary usage between classes.
- Assess lexical diversity.

### 4.4 Statistical Summary
- Compute basic descriptive statistics.
- Present results using tables and visualizations.

---

## 5. Text Cleaning and Preparation

- Standardize text formatting:
  - normalize case,
  - remove technical artifacts.
- Preserve elements important for stylistic analysis.
- Ensure all texts are written in the same language.

---

## 6. Dataset Normalization

- Evaluate whether texts from different classes are comparable in terms of length and structure.
- If necessary:
  - remove extreme outliers,
  - normalize distributions to improve comparability.
- Document all data modifications clearly.

---

## 7. Feature Extraction

### 7.1 Text Representation
- Transform text into a numerical representation suitable for machine learning models.
- Describe and justify the chosen representation method.

### 7.2 Stylometric and Statistical Features
- Extract numerical features that describe writing style and structure.
- Analyze which features may help distinguish between classes.

### 7.3 Feature Preparation
- Normalize numerical features to a common scale.
- Combine different feature types into a single representation.

---

## 8. Model Development

- Select a baseline classification model.
- Implement a consistent training pipeline that includes preprocessing and model training.
- Use the baseline model as a reference point for further comparisons.

---

## 9. Model Comparison and Tuning

- Train and evaluate alternative models.
- Compare their performance against the baseline.
- Investigate how model parameters influence classification results.

---

## 10. Model Evaluation

- Evaluate models using standard classification metrics.
- Analyze results separately for each class.
- Visualize correct and incorrect predictions.

---

## 11. Error Analysis and Interpretation

- Inspect misclassified examples.
- Identify recurring patterns in classification errors.
- Discuss limitations of the current approach.

---

## 12. Experiments and Comparative Analysis

- Compare different data preparation strategies and feature sets.
- Analyze how changes in the pipeline affect performance.
- Summarize insights gained from experiments.

---

## 13. Testing and Robustness

- Verify the correctness of key data processing steps.
- Ensure the pipeline behaves consistently across runs.
- Protect critical components with basic automated tests.

---

## 14. Project Organization

- Structure the codebase for clarity and extensibility.
- Separate responsibilities across modules.
- Track project evolution using version control.

---

## 15. Final Observations

- Summarize the main findings of the project.
- Discuss strengths and weaknesses of the approach.
- Outline possible directions for future improvements.

---

## 16. Documentation and Transparency

- Prepare documentation accessible to external readers.
- Explain methodological choices and design decisions.
- Ensure the project is reproducible and easy to understand.
